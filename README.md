# BrainFart

BrainFart is a PG version of [Brainf*ck](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brainfuck). Everything about it is the same. It uses the same instructions, and the same syntax.

The purpose of this project is to encourage educators to teach students the absolute fundamentals of programming - including things like Turing completeness, and the concept of a Turing machine. BrainFart is a great way to do this, because it is so simple, and so easy to understand. It is also a great way to introduce learners to the concept of a computation and states of a program.

(To be honest, one difference is that the default memory size is 1000 cells, instead of 30,000.)
